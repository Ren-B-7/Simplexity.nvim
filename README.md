# nvim-installation-package
A default package to get a vs-code like setup for nvim, with linting, lsp, formatting, auto-completion, git integration, highlighting, file trees and even trouble

# Adding external apt servers
Firstly ensure you have external servers added to apt

go to start menu > Software & Updates > tick everything under Ubuntu Software to true

Set updates to what ever, it is your pc

# Text file 1 (sudo_me)
Now copy the contents of "sudo_me.txt", paste this into the ubuntu terminal

You will likely have to press "y" a lot

This also updates the apt list, and updates all packages before hand

# Text file 2 (sudo_me_later)
Secondly do the same for "sudo_me_later.txt", paste this as well

This is an extended font format for extra images and icons added to nvim

# Finally nvim.zip
Then finally go to ~/.config/ and paste the "nvim.zip" file here and do command "unzip ~/.local/nvim.zip", or alternatively extract elsewhere and paste the nvim file here

Then run nvim in your terminal, and all should be well, if not contact owner, cause you fucked up
